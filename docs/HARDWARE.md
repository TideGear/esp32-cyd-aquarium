# Hardware

This firmware is tested on the ESP32-2432S028R / Cheap Yellow Display style
board.

## Tested Board

- ESP32-2432S028R / CYD style board.
- ESP32-WROOM-32 class module.
- 2.8 inch 240x320 ILI9341 TFT.
- XPT2046 resistive touch controller.
- USB serial through a CH340-class bridge on many boards.
- Onboard ambient light sensor connected to GPIO34 on the tested board.

CYD clones vary. Some boards use different LCD controller variants, different
backlight wiring, or omit parts of the light-sensor circuit.

The default aquarium build uses the CYD display, touch controller, and optional
onboard light sensor only. External temperature, humidity, or CO2 sensors are
not required for this adaptation.

## Known Working Display Setup

The default `esp32-2432s028r` PlatformIO environment uses:

- `ILI9341_2_DRIVER`
- `USE_HSPI_PORT`
- `TFT_BACKLIGHT_ON=HIGH`
- `TFT_INVERSION_ON`
- `CYD_TFT_SWAP_BYTES=1`
- `CYD_TFT_ROTATION=2`
- `CYD_DOT_RENDERER=1`
- `CYD_FRAMEBUFFER_RENDERER=0`
- Physical display: `240x320`
- Aquarium logical frame: `80x106`
- Viewport: `0,1 240x318`

| Ambient light sensor | 34 |

## Backlight

Backlight is controlled independently from aquarium colors.

- Backlight pin: GPIO21.
- PWM frequency: 5000 Hz.
- PWM resolution: 8 bit.
- The firmware changes the physical TFT backlight, not the RGB aquarium color
  calibration.

## Ambient Light Sensor

The tested board has an onboard LDR circuit on GPIO34.

The observed behavior is inverted:

- lower raw ADC value means brighter room;
- higher raw ADC value means darker room.

The default calibration maps:

- raw `<= 10` to `100%` backlight;
- raw `>= 650` to `38%` backlight.

If your board responds differently, adjust the `CYD_AUTO_BACKLIGHT_*` build
flags in `platformio.ini`.
